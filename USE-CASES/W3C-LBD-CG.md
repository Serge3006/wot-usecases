### Target Users

- device owners
- device user
- service provider
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

When designing or operating building automation and control systems a substantial effort is spend for giving informational context to some monitoring or control data. Indeed each application or person that consumes that data requires information about its content and its origin:
- which device produces the data (sensor, merter, actuator...)
- which physical quantity or aspects it represents with which quality
- which elements in a building relate directly or indirectly to that data.
- it is possible to automatically track down that data in a complex system like a building

For that purpose, current practice by providers and users is to make use of data properties, metadata and naming conventions which are implemented in BMS databases.
Such information relates mainly to some topological elements of a building where the data is produced or used: space, zone, storey, HVAC component, HVAC zone, etc. Additionally, many other properties are introduced like cost, manufacturer data. One difficulty is especially the lack of normalized way of creating and sharing this information. On the contrary manufacturers, service provider and users introduce their own data which is tailored for their specific use but this results in heterogeneity and lack of interoperabilty.   

This issues are typically the goal of Linked Data which aims at restoring interoperabilty and data sharing between different systems and users.

The emancipation of Web and IoT technologies can support automating the difficult process of metadata creation and management. It could even automate that process by applying Web of Things standards.

### Expected Devices:

<List the target devices, e.g. as a sensor, solar panel, air conditioner>

### Expected Data:

<List the type of expected data, e.g. weather and climate data, medical conditions, machine sensors, vehicle data>

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

<List the affected WoT deliverables that have to be changed to enable this use case>

### Description:

Goal of this use case is to automate the process of metadata creation and sharing within building management systems using smart devices that implement Linked Data and Web of Things. Linked Data provides the vocabularies that can universally be use for giving semantics and contextual information to data and Web of Things provides necessary decription and structure allowing sharing of data across smart devices using web communication protocols.

Metadata in devices about its location in a building and its related physical elements could be entered initially by BACS providers when placing the devices. Or a device could derive its location from an indoor positioning system delivering him its relative coordinates within a building and from a virtual BIM model representing the topological elements related to that coordinates.
