### Motivation:

When operating buildings, aggregating and managing all data provided by their heterogeneous devices still require lot of manual settings. Besides the hurdles of data acquisition that relies on multiple protocols, data generally lack much contextual information and metadata about its location and purpose. Usually, each service or application that consumes data requires information about its content and its context like e.g.:
- which thing produces the data (sensor, meter, actuator, other technical component...)
- which physical quantity or process is represented (temperature, energy supply, monitoring, actuation)
- which other building things are involved (e.g. sensor hosted by a duct or a space).

Automatically tracking down data and their related things in a building would especially ease the configuration and operation of BACS systems and HVAC services during commissioning, operation, maintenance and retrofitting. For now, providers and users make use of data properties, metadata and naming conventions which are manually implemented in BMS databases to annotate data and things. Such information relates mainly to some topological elements of a building where the data is produced or used: space, zone, HVAC component, etc. Additionally, many other properties are introduced like cost or specific manufacturer data. One difficulty is especially the lack of normalized way of creating and sharing this information in an automated manner. On the contrary manufacturers, service providers and users introduce their own metadata which are tailored for their specific use or ecosystem. This issues are already partially addressed by the Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description (TD) which aims at providing normalized and syntactic interoperability between things. This use case proposes to enhance the semantic interoperability of the WoT by making use of semantic web that relies on same technological background and especially of ontologies from the Linked Building Data domain. Is should serve many applications for an Internet of Building Things (IoBT).

### Expected Devices:

- Actuators
- Sensors
- Devices from the building context
- Devices from the HVAC system
- Smart devices

### Expected Data:

- 2D location
- Depth position (height position)
- Geolocation
- Semantic location
- Sensor ID
- Thing Descriptions

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- Web of Things Thing Description (WoT TD) needed

### Description:

Goal of this use case is to show the potential to automate workflows in smart building management by using a combination of Web of Data standards including Web of Things Thing Description.

#### Combining Location and Thing Descriptions

The use case is related to the maintenance of Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS), where a [temperature sensor](https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp-Sensor) is replaced with a new one. The following thing description describes a kitchen with a number of sensors, including the replaced one, in a building (The use case is based on the [Open Smart Home Dataset](https://github.com/TechnicalBuildingSystems/OpenSmartHomeData)).

Example thing description of a [kitchen](https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen) where the temperature sensor is deployed:

```json
{
    "id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen",
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/td/v1",
        {
            "bot": "https://w3id.org/bot#",
            "sosa": "http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/",
            "ssn": "http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/",
            "dog": "http://elite.polito.it/ontologies/dogont.owl#"
        }
    ],
    "title": "Kitchen",
    "@type": ["bot:Space", "dog:Kitchen", "sosa:FeatureOfInterest"],
    "securityDefinitions": {
        "basic_sc": {
            "scheme": "basic",
            "in": "header"
        }
    },
    "security": [
		"basic_sc"
	],
    "bot:containsElement": [{
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp-Sensor"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-tempT-Sensor"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-humid-Sensor"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-brigh-Sensor"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-tempS-Actuator"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-heater"
        }
    ],
    "ssn:hasProperty": {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp",
        "@type": "sosa:ObservableProperty",
        "sosa:isObservedBy": {
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp-Sensor"
        }
    }
}
```

The location information of the tangible object [kitchen](https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen) is provided based on the [Building Topology Ontology (BOT)](https://w3id.org/bot), a minimal ontology developed by the [W3C Linked Building Data Community Group (W3c LBD CG)](https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/) to describe the topology of buildings in the semantic web.

The topological information localising the things, e.g. the [temperature sensor](https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp-Sensor) can be used to automatically commission the newly replaced sensor and link it to existing control algorithms. For this purpose the identifiers of suitable sensors and actuators are needed and can be, for example, queried via [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/).

```sparql
PREFIX bot: <https://w3id.org/bot>
PREFIX brick: <https://brickschema.org/schema/1.1/Brick#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?sensor ?actuator
WHERE{
  ?space rdf:type bot:Space .
  ?space bot:containsElement ?sensor .
  ?space bot:containsElement ?actuator .
  ?sensor rdf:type brick:Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor .
  ?actuator rdf:type brick:Zone_Air_Temperature_Setpoint .
}
```
Or a similar query can be implemented within an API built upon the [HTTP:](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4) scheme. Below is an example endpoint applying [REST](https://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) style for getting same information for a specific space name:
```
GET "https://example-wot-servername/api/locations?space=Kitchen&sensors=true&actuators=true"
API response:
{
  "location": {
    "site": {
      "id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Site1",
      "name": "Site1"
    },
    "building": {
      "id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Building1",
      "name": "Building1"
    },
    "zone": null,
    "storey": {
      "id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Level2",
      "name": "Level2"
    },
    "space": {
      "id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen",
      "name": "Kitchen"
    },
  "sensors": [
    "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp-Sensor",
    "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-tempT-Sensor",
    "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-humid-Sensor",
    "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-brigh-Sensor"
  ],
  "actuators": [
    "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-tempS-Actuator"
  ]
}
```
One developer could also implement the previous SPARQL query within GraphQL web query language for obtaining similar JSON response objects (ToDo: GraphQL description and example in next patch):  

#### Automated Update of Fault Detection Rule based on Thing Description

Another use case in smart buildings, which would greatly benefit from harmonised thing descriptions is related to the detection of unexpected behaviour and faults. An example for such a fault detection is the rule-based surveillance of sensor values. Again in the case of maintenance a sensor is replaced as described above. The respective sensor includes its operation range in its TD (see example below). There the operating range is specified using the [SOSA/SSN](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) ontology.

```json
{
    "id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp-Sensor",
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/td/v1",
        {
            "bot": "https://w3id.org/bot#",
            "sosa": "http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/",
            "ssn": "http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/",
            "om": "http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/",
            "dog": "http://elite.polito.it/ontologies/dogont.owl#",
	    "brick": "https://brickschema.org/schema/1.1/Brick#"
        }
    ],
    "title": "Kitchen-temp-Sensor",
    "description": "Kitchen Temperature Sensor",
    "@type": ["sosa:Sensor", "dog:TemperatureSensor", "bot:element" , brick:Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor],
    "@reverse": {
        "bot:containsElement": {"@id": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen"}
    },
    "securityDefinitions": {
        "basic_sc": {
            "scheme": "basic",
            "in": "header"
        }
    },
    "security": [
        "basic_sc"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "Kitchen-temp": {
            "ssn:forProperty": "https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp",
            "type": "number",
            "minimum": 0.0,
            "maximum": 40.0,
            "unit": "om:degree_Celsius",
            "forms": [
                {
                    "href": "https://kitchen.example.com/temp",
                    "contentType": "application/json",
                    "op": "readproperty"
                }
            ],
            "readOnly": true,
            "writeOnly": false
        }
    }
}
```

In this use case the thing description is utlisied to update the parameters of the rule checking the upper and lower bound of the values provided by the [sensor](https://w3id.org/ibp/osh/OpenSmartHomeDataSet#Kitchen-temp-Sensor).
